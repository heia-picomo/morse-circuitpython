# Morse Code Transmitter

This is a simple Morse Code Transmitter for the PicoMo. It uses the PicoMo's LED and buzzer to transmit
predefined messages in Morse Code.

## Usage

- [Optional] In order to start with a clean slate, you can completely wipe the PicoMo using the `flash_nuke.uf2` file (see https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/circuitpython for detail)
- Download the [Latest version of Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/board/picomo_v2/) for the PicoMo.
- Install the Circuit Python firmware on the PicoMo.
- Download this repository [as a zip file](https://github.com/heia-picomo/morse-circuitpython/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it (for example on your desktop).
- Drag and drop the content of the `morse-circuitpython-main` folder onto the PicoMo.
- Open the PicoMo in _Visual Studio Code_ to edit the `code.py` file.
